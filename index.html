        <p>Monk is a brand new Champion who has spent years studying his unique fighting style in his Arena, the Silent Sanctuary. <br>This Arena is where he will be unlockable on the Trophy Road at 6500 Trophies!
<br> When attacking, Monk unleashes a powerful 3-hit combo that pushes back enemies with the final strike! <br>This final super-punch includes a pushback which deals extra damage to every affected unit (like the Log).</p>

        <h2>SPECIAL ABILITY</h2>
        <p>Monk channels his meditative powers through Pensive Protection, creating a protective aura around himself and nearby allies, reducing Damage taken and reflecting any projectile that comes his way.

            Yes, this includes Rockets!</p>

        <img src="./CSS/Resources/pheonix card.png" alt="Pheonix Card Clash royale" height="300px" width="auto">
        <p>Phoenix is a new Legendary flying unit with Melee Attacks. Once defeated, it will explode in a fiery… fire… <br>and deal Area Damage to nearby units and buildings, retreating into a Phoenix Egg.

            <br>If this Egg is not destroyed in time, Phoenix will be reborn (bet you didn’t see that one coming) at full Hitpoints, ready to fight again!<br>
            
            Note: Phoenix will only be reborn from an Egg once per deploy.</p>
